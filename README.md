## About

My take on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using JS

## Progress

Just started this awesome adventure so I'm kinda late to the party.

![28%](https://progress-bar.dev/28) 14/50 stars

## Run

Type in terminal using node:

```
node <day number>
```

Where _\<day number\>_ is a number between 1 and 7.

The script grabs input from input.js in a corresponging directory and prints calculated results to the console.
