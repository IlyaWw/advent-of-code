## About

My take on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using JS

## Progress

Just started this awesome adventure so I'm kinda late to the party.
1/25 ![4%]https://progress-bar.dev/4

## Run

Type in terminal using node:

```
node 1/index.js
```

The script grabs input from input.js in a corresponging directory and prints calculated results to the console.
